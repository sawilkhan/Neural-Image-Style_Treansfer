# Neural-Image-Style_Treansfer
Neural network to transfer style of an image to content of another.
•	Neural network to transfer the style of an image onto the content of another image.
•	Used to VGG16 models, with Average Pool to get the content and style losses. L- BFGS to minimize the combined content and style loss function. Noisy image pixels optimized instead of weights.
